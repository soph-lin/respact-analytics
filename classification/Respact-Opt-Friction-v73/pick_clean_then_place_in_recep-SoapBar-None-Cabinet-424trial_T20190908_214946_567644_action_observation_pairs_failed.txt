OK.
3: > speak: I am looking for a soapbar. A soapbar is more likely to appear in sinkbasin (1-2), countertop (1), cabinet (1-4). Where should I look first?
Human: Please look for the soapbar in toilet 1 first.
4: > speak: The toilet is not a likely place for a soapbar. Should I look in the sinkbasin 1 first instead?
Human: No, please follow the plan and look for the soapbar 2 in toilet 1 first.
