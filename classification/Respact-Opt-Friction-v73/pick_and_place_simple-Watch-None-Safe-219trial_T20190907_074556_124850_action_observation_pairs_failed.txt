Your task is to: put some watch on safe.
1: > think: To solve the task, I need to find and take a watch, then put it on the safe.
OK.
2: > think: First I need to find a watch. A watch is more likely to appear in drawers (1-5), dresser (1), sidetable (1), and shelves (1-12). Let me check with the user.
OK.
3: > speak: I need to find a watch. A watch is more likely to appear in drawers (1-5), dresser (1), sidetable (1), and shelves (1-12). Where do you suggest I should look for the watch first?

5: > act: go to dresser 1
On the dresser 1, you see a box 1, a cellphone 2, a cellphone 1, a keychain 1, a laptop 1, a newspaper 1, and a watch 3.

7: > take watch 3 from dresser 1

8: > act: take watch 3 from dresser 1
You pick up the watch 3 from the dresser 1.
9: > think: Now I have the watch. Next, I need to put it on the safe. I should go to the safe first.

You open the safe 1. The safe 1 is open. In it, you see a vase 3, and a vase 2.

OK.
15: > act: put watch 3 on safe 1
Nothing happens.
16: > speak: I am unable to put the watch on the safe. Can you help me?
