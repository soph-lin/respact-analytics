Your task is to: put some watch on safe.
1: Act 1: think: To solve the task, I need to find and take a watch, then put it on the safe. A watch is more likely to appear in drawers, dressers, shelves, or sidetables. Let me ask where to look for the watch first. 
Obs 1: OK.
2: Act 2: speak: I need to find a watch. A watch is more likely to appear in drawers (1-5), dresser (1), shelves (1-12), or sidetable (1). Where do you suggest I should look for the watch first? 
Obs 2: Human: Can you please check the dresser 1?
3: Act 3: go to dresser 1 
Obs 3: On the dresser 1, you see a box 1, a cellphone 2, a cellphone 1, a keychain 1, a laptop 1, a newspaper 1, and a watch 3.
4: Act 4: think: Now that I have found a watch (3) on the dresser, I need to take it and then put it on the safe. 
Obs 4: OK.

Obs 5: You pick up the watch 3 from the dresser 1.
6: Act 6: think: Now that I have taken the watch (3), I need to go to the safe and put the watch on it. 
Obs 6: OK.
7: Act 7: go to safe 1 
Obs 7: The safe 1 is closed.
8: Act 8: think: The safe is closed, but since the task is to put the watch on the safe, I don't need to open it. I can simply place the watch on top of the closed safe. 
Obs 8: OK.
9: Act 9: put watch 3 in/on safe 1 
Obs 9: Nothing happens.
10: Act 10: think: It seems there was an issue with placing the watch on the safe. I should try again to ensure the action is completed correctly. 
Obs 10: OK.
11: Act 11: put watch 3 in/on safe 1 
Obs 11: Nothing happens.
12: Act 12: think: It seems there is a persistent issue with placing the watch on the safe. I should verify if there are any specific conditions or requirements for placing items on the safe, or if there is an alternative approach to complete the task. 
Obs 12: OK.
13: Act 13: think: It seems there is a persistent issue with placing the watch on the safe. I should verify if there are any specific conditions or requirements for placing items on the safe, or if there is an alternative approach to complete the task. Since the safe is closed, I might need to open it first to place the watch inside, even though the task specifies "on" the safe. Let me try opening the safe and see if that resolves the issue. 
Obs 13: OK.
14: Act 14: open safe 1 
Obs 14: You open the safe 1. The safe 1 is open. In it, you see a vase 3, and a vase 2.
15: Act 15: think: Now that the safe is open, I can try placing the watch inside the safe to complete the task. Although the task specifies "on" the safe, placing it inside might be the intended action. 
Obs 15: OK.
16: Act 16: put watch 3 in/on safe 1 
Obs 16: You put the watch 3 in/on the safe 1.
