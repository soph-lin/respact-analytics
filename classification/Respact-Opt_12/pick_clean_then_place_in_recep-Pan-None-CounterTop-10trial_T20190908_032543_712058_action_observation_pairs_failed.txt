0: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.
Your task is to: put a clean pan in countertop.
1: Act 1: think: To solve the task, I need to find a pan, clean it, and then put it on the countertop. First, I need to locate a pan. A pan is likely to be found in cabinets, drawers, or on countertops. Let me ask where I should start looking for the pan. 
Obs 1: OK.
2: Act 2: speak: I think a pan is more likely to appear in cabinets (1-6), drawers (1-3), or on countertops (1-3). Where should I look for the pan first? 
Obs 2: Human: Can you please check stoveburner 3?
3: Act 3: go to stoveburner 3 
Obs 3: On the stoveburner 3, you see a pan 1.
4: Act 4: think: I have found a pan (1) on stoveburner 3. Next, I need to clean it before putting it on the countertop. I should go to the sinkbasin to clean the pan. 
Obs 4: OK.
5: Act 5: go to sinkbasin 1 
Obs 5: On the sinkbasin 1, you see nothing.
6: Act 6: clean pan 1 with sinkbasin 1 
Obs 6: Nothing happens.
7: Act 7: think: It seems that cleaning the pan with the sinkbasin did not work. I should check if the pan is already clean or if there's another way to clean it. Let me look around to see if there's anything else that might help with cleaning. 
Obs 7: OK.
8: Act 8: think: Since cleaning the pan with the sinkbasin did not work, it's possible that the pan is already clean or that I need a different method to clean it. I should verify if the pan is already clean or if there's another cleaning method available. Let me look around to see if there's any indication of the pan's cleanliness or any cleaning supplies nearby. 
Obs 8: OK.
9: Act 9: think: Since cleaning the pan with the sinkbasin did not work, it's possible that the pan is already clean. I should proceed to put the pan on the countertop as the task requires. If the pan was not clean, there might have been a specific cleaning method or tool needed, but since I don't see any, I'll assume it's clean. Let me go to the countertop and place the pan there. 
Obs 9: OK.
10: Act 10: go to countertop 1 
Obs 10: On the countertop 1, you see a mug 2, and a pan 1.
11: Act 11: put pan 1 in/on countertop 1 
Obs 11: Nothing happens.
