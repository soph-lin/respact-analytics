    """
    return AzureOpenAI(

        azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
        api_version="2024-02-15-preview",
    )

client = get_openai_client()

statement = "I need to find an alarmclock. An alarmclock is more likely to appear in desk (1-2), drawer (1-6), shelf (1-6), bed (1), garbagecan (1), laundryhamper (1). Where do you suggest I should look for the alarmclock first?"

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
