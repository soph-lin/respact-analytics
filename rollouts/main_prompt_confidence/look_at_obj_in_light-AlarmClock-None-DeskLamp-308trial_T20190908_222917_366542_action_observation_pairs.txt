Obs 6: Nothing happens.
7: Act 7: think: I have already checked desk 2 for the desklamp, and nothing was found there. I should now look in the other possible locations for the desklamp, which are drawer (1-6) and shelf (1-6). I will ask where to look next. My confidence level is 8 since I have a clear plan to check the remaining locations. 
Obs 7: OK.

Obs 15: Nothing happens.
16: Act 16: think: I have already checked desk 1, and nothing happened when I tried to go there again.
