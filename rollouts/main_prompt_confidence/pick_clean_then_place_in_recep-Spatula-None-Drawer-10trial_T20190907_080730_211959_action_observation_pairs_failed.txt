0: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.
Your task is to: put a clean spatula in drawer.
1: Act 1: think: To solve the task, I need to find a spatula, clean it if necessary, and then put it in the drawer. First, I need to locate the spatula. It is likely to be found in the kitchen area, such as the cabinets, drawers, or countertops. I will start by looking in the cabinets. 
Obs 1: OK.
2: Act 2: speak: I will start by looking for the spatula in the cabinets. Let's check cabinet 1 first. 
Obs 2: Human: Can you please check countertop 3?
3: Act 3: go to countertop 3 
Obs 3: On the countertop 3, you see a bread 1, a creditcard 1, a houseplant 1, a knife 2, a spatula 1, a spoon 1, and a statue 2.
4: Act 4: think: I have found a spatula (1) on countertop 3. Next, I need to check if it is clean. Since I need to put a clean spatula in the drawer, I will clean it with the sinkbasin if necessary. 
Obs 4: OK.
5: Act 5: clean spatula 1 with sinkbasin 1 
Obs 5: Nothing happens.
6: Act 6: think: I need to check if the spatula is clean or if it requires cleaning. Since cleaning it with the sinkbasin did not yield any results, I should check if there are any other cleaning options available or if I can directly put the spatula in the drawer. My confidence level is 6 because I'm unsure if the spatula is clean or if I need to find another way to clean it. I will ask for guidance on what to do next. 
Obs 6: OK.
7: Act 7: speak: I found a spatula (1) on countertop 3, but cleaning it with the sinkbasin did not yield any results. I'm unsure if the spatula is clean or if I need to find another way to clean it. Should I check another cleaning option or can I directly put the spatula in the drawer? 
Obs 7: Human: You can go ahead and put the spatula 1 in/on drawer 1.
8: Act 8: put spatula 1 in/on drawer 1 
Obs 8: Nothing happens.
9: Act 9: think: It seems that putting the spatula in the drawer did not work. This could mean that the drawer is not the correct receptacle for the spatula, or the spatula may not be accepted in the drawer for some reason. I need to consider other options. I will check if the spatula can be cleaned again or if I should try a different drawer. My confidence level is 5 because I'm uncertain about the next step. I will ask for guidance on what to do next 
Obs 9: OK.
10: Act 10: speak: I attempted to put the spatula in drawer 1, but it did not work. I'm uncertain if I should try cleaning the spatula again or check a different drawer. What should I do next? 
Obs 10: Human: Can you please clean the spatula again with the sinkbasin 1?
11: Act 11: clean spatula 1 with sinkbasin 1 
Obs 11: Nothing happens.
12: Act 12: think: It seems that cleaning the spatula with the sinkbasin did not yield any results again. This suggests that the spatula may already be clean or that the cleaning method is ineffective. Since I cannot put the spatula in drawer 1 and cleaning it has not worked, I need to consider other options. I will check if there are other drawers available to put the spatula in. My confidence level is 6 because I'm unsure about the next step. I will ask for guidance 
Obs 12: OK.
13: Act 13: speak: I have tried cleaning the spatula with the sinkbasin twice, and it did not yield any results. I also attempted to put the spatula in drawer 1, but that did not work either. Should I check a different drawer or look for another cleaning option? What should I do next? 
Obs 13: Human: Can you please go to countertop 3 and take the spatula 1 again?
14: Act 14: take spatula 1 from countertop 3 
Obs 14: You pick up the spatula 1 from the countertop 3.
15: Act 15: think: I have taken the spatula (1) from countertop 3 again. Since cleaning it with the sinkbasin did not yield any results, I need to consider my next steps. I could try to put it in a different drawer or check if there are any other cleaning options available. My confidence level is 6 because I'm unsure about the next step. I will ask for guidance. 
Obs 15: OK.
16: Act 16: speak: I have taken the spatula (1) from countertop 3 again. Since cleaning it with the sinkbasin did not yield any results, should I try putting it in a different drawer or look for another cleaning option? What should I do next? 
Obs 16: Human: Can you please go to drawer 1 and put the spatula 1 in/on it?
17: Act 17: go to drawer 1 
Obs 17: The drawer 1 is closed.
18: Act 18: open drawer 1
