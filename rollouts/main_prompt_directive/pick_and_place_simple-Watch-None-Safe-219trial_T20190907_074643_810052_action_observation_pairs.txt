Obs 2: OK.
3: Act 3: speak: I need to find a watch. A watch is more likely to appear in drawers (1-5), cabinets (1-4), on the sidetable (1), or on the sofa (1). Where do you suggest I should look for the watch first? 
Obs 3: Human: Can you please check drawer 5?
4: Act 4: go to drawer 5 
Obs 4: The drawer 5 is closed.
5: Act 5: open drawer 5 
Obs 5: You open the drawer 5. The drawer 5 is open. In it, you see a watch 1.

Obs 11: OK.
12: Act 12: put watch 1 on safe 1 
Obs 12: Nothing happens.
13: Act 13: think: It seems that putting the watch directly on the safe did not work. I need to consider that the safe might not be a suitable place for placing items on top of it. I should check if there are any other suitable places nearby to put the watch. The sidetable or the sofa might be good alternatives. Let me ask for direction on where to put the watch instead. 
Obs 13: OK.
14: Act 14: speak: I need to put the watch somewhere, but placing it on the safe did not work. Would you like me to put the watch on the sidetable or the sofa instead? 
Obs 14: Human: Can you please put the watch in the safe 1?
15: Act 15: put watch 1 in/on safe 1 
Obs 15: You put the watch 1 in/on the safe 1.
